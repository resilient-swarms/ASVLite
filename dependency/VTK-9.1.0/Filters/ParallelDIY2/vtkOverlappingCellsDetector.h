/**
 * @class vtkOverlappingCellsDetector
 * @brief Exposes how many cells each cell of the input collide.
 *
 * This filter performs a cell collision detection between the cells of the input.
 * This detection takes the form of a cell array of double. Its name can be
 * reached from the static string attribute
 * vtkOverlappingCellsDetector::NumberOfOverlapsPerCell.
 *
 * To detect collisions, coarse bounding spheres are estimated for each cell of the input.
 * The center of those spheres is stored in a point cloud which is used to find potential
 * colliding cells candidates, querying with twice the bounding sphere radius to ensure
 * we do not miss other bouding sphere centers. Duplicate intersections might appear during
 * this process, so a sphere id map is stored to avoid adding already added overlapping cell ids.
 *
 * This filter works in a multi-process environment. When so, each cell of the input
 * whose bounding sphere and bounding box intersects another process is added in
 * a temporary `vtkUnstructuredGrid` being sent to this process. Cell collision
 * is then performed, and the collision id map is sent back. This map is then
 * read to look if any of those cells were not already counted (local process
 * could have spotted the same collision from
 * the cells sent by the other process indeed). One cell id collision map is stored
 * per neighbor process to avoid cell id collision.
 *
 * The user can set a `Tolerance` parameter. It is set by default to zero. When
 * it is equal to zero or is lower to floating point precision,
 * then floating point precision is used to compute cell
 * overlaps. If it is not set to zero, then each cells are deflated by `0.5 *
 * Tolerance` before the overlaps are computed. The deflation is computed using
 * `vtkCell::Inflate` with a negative parameter.

   * Method performing the cell detection.
   * There are 2 main types of inputs: query inputs, as well as inputs where to search.
   * Points in point clouds represent bounding spheres of corresponding cell data set.
   * Each point is associated with a radius.
   * Bounding boxes must match the bounding boxes of corresponding cells in data sets.
   *
   * The algorithm goes as follows:
   * - For each query point in queryPointCloud, a neighborhood is searched in pointCloud
   * - For each neighbor found, a collision test is performed between query cell associated
   *   to query point and each cells associated with points found in the neighborhood.
   * - If the test is positive, arrays of double associated with both datasets are
   *   incremented
   *
   * Last input CollisionListMaps is here to store the list of intersected cell ids from the query,
   * mapped to the id of input cellDataSet. This object is used to avoid double counting
   * collisions when sending back collision information to every block.
   *
   * This function can be called with queryCellDataSet and queryDataSet pointing to the same
   * object in memory.

   * Precondition: cellDataSet MUST have the cell array named NumberOfOverlapsPerCellArrayName()
