 * @class   vtkGeometryFilter
 * @brief   extract boundary geometry from dataset (or convert data to polygonal type)
 *
 * vtkGeometryFilter is a general-purpose filter to extract dataset boundary
 * geometry, topology, and associated attribute data from any type of
 * dataset. Geometry is obtained as follows: all 0D, 1D, and 2D cells are
 * extracted. All 2D faces that are used by only one 3D cell (i.e., boundary
 * faces) are extracted. It also is possible to specify conditions on point
 * ids, cell ids, and on a bounding box (referred to as "Extent") to control
 * the extraction process.  This point and cell id- and extent-based clipping
 * is a powerful way to "see inside" datasets; however it may impact
 * performance significantly.
 *
 * This filter may also be used to convert any type of data to polygonal
 * type. This is particularly useful for surface rendering. The conversion
 * process may be less than satisfactory for some 3D datasets. For example,
 * this filter will extract the outer surface of a volume or structured grid
 * dataset (if point, cell, and extent clipping is disabled). (For structured
 * data you may want to use vtkImageDataGeometryFilter,
 * vtkStructuredGridGeometryFilter, vtkExtractUnstructuredGrid,
 * vtkRectilinearGridGeometryFilter, or vtkExtractVOI.)
 *
 * Another important feature of vtkGeometryFilter is that it preserves
 * topological connectivity. This enables filters that depend on correct
 * connectivity (e.g., vtkQuadricDecimation, vtkFeatureEdges, etc.) to
 * operate properly . It is possible to label the output polydata with an
 * originating cell (PassThroughCellIds) or point id (PassThroughPointIds).
 * The output precision of created points (if they need to be created) can
 * also be specified.
 *
 * In some cases (especially for large unstructured grids) the
 * vtkGeometryFilter can be slow. Consequently the filter has an optional
 * "fast mode" that may execute significantly faster (>4-5x) than normal
 * execution. The fast mode visits a subset of cells that may be on the
 * boundary of the dataset (and skips interior cells which contribute nothing
 * to the output). The set of subsetted cells is determined by inspecting
 * the topological connectivity degree of each point (i.e., the number of
 * unique cells using a particular point is that point's degree). With fast
 * mode enabled, those cells connected to a point with degree <= Degree
 * are visited. Note that this approach may miss some cells which contribute
 * boundary faces--thus the output is an approximation to the normal
 * execution of vtkGeometryFilter.
 *
 * Finally, this filter takes an optional second, vtkPolyData input. This
 * input represents a list of faces that are to be excluded from the output
 * of vtkGeometryFilter.
 *
 * @warning
 * While vtkGeometryFilter and vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter perform similar operations,
 * there are important differences as follows:
 * 1. vtkGeometryFilter preserves topological connectivity. vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter
 *    produces output primitives which may be disconnected from one another.
 * 2. vtkGeometryFilter can generate output based on cell ids, point ids, and/or
 *    extent (bounding box) clipping. vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter strictly extracts
 *    the boundary surface of a dataset.
 * 3. vtkGeometryFilter is much faster than vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter, especially
 *    for vtkUnstructuredGrids. As a result, vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter will
 *    delegate the processing of linear unstructured grids to vtkGeometryFilter.
 * 4. vtkGeometryFilter can (currently) only handle linear cells. The filter
 *    will delegate to vtkDataSetSurfaceFilter for higher-order cells. (This
 *    is a historical artifact and may be rectified in the future.)
 *
 * @warning
 * If point merging (MergingOff) is disabled, the filter will (if possible)
 * use the input points and point attributes.  This can result in a lot of
 * unused points in the output, at some gain in filter performance.  If
 * enabled, point merging will generate only new points that are used by the
 * output polydata cells.
 *
 * @warning
 * This class has been threaded with vtkSMPTools. Using TBB or other
 * non-sequential type (set in the CMake variable
 * VTK_SMP_IMPLEMENTATION_TYPE) may improve performance significantly.
