/**
 * @class   vtkPLagrangianParticleTracker
 * @brief    parallel Lagrangian particle tracker
 *
 * This class implements parallel Lagrangian particle tracker.
 * The implementation is as follows:
 * First seeds input is parsed to create particle in each rank
 * Particles which are not contained by the flow in a rank are sent to other ranks
 * which can potentially contain it and will grab only if they actually contain it
 * Then each rank begin integrating.
 * When a particle goes out of domain, the particle will be sent to other ranks
 * the same way.
 * When a rank runs out of particle, it waits for other potential particles
 * from other ranks.
 * When all ranks run out of particles, integration is over.
 * The master rank takes care of communications between rank regarding integration termination
 * particles are directly streamed rank to rank, without going through the master
 *
