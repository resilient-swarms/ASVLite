 * @class   vtkBinnedDecimation
 * @brief   reduce the number of triangles in a vtkPolyData mesh
 *
 * vtkBinnedDecimation is a filter to reduce the number of triangles in a
 * triangle mesh represented by vtkPolyData. It is similar to
 * vtkQuadricClustering in concept, although it is performance accelerated:
 * it does not use quadric error metrics to position points in the bins, plus
 * it is threaded. (See vtkQuadricClustering for more information.) It also
 * takes some short cuts in the interest of speed: it limits the binning
 * resolution to no more than 2^31 bins; and it can (optionally) reuse the input
 * points in the output (to save memory and computational costs).
 *
 * A high-level overview of the algorithm is as follows. Points are binned
 * into a regular grid subdivided in the x-y-z directions. The idea is to
 * combine all the points within each bin into a single point which is then
 * used by the output triangles. Four options are available to generate the
 * output points. If the input points are to be reused as the output points,
 * then all points in the same bin simply adopt the coordinates of one of the
 * selected points in the bin (and thus all points in the bin take on the
 * same output point id). Alternatively, if new output points are to be
 * generated, then either one point is selected; the centers of occupied bins
 * can be used as the output point coordinates; or an average position of all
 * points falling into the bin can be used to generate the bin
 * point. Finally, triangles are inserted into the output: triangles whose
 * three, binned points lie in separate bins are sent to the output, while
 * all others are discarded (i.e., triangles with two or more points in the
 * same bin are not sent to the output).
 *
 * To use this filter, specify the divisions defining the spatial subdivision
 * in the x, y, and z directions. Of course you must also specify an input
 * vtkPolyData / filter connection. Higher division levels generally produce
 * results closer to the original mesh. Note that for performance reasons
 * (i.e., related to memory), the maximum divisions in the x-y-z directions
 * is limited in such a way (i.e., proportional scaling of divisions is used)
 * so as to ensure that no more than 2^31 bins are used. Higher divisions have
 * modest impact on the overall performance of the algorithm, although the
 * resolution of the output vtkPolyData is affected significantly (i.e., many
 * more triangles may be generated).
 *
 * @warning
 * This filter can drastically affect mesh topology, i.e., topology is not
 * preserved.
 *
 * @warning
 * This filter and vtkQuadricClustering produce similar results, with
 * vtkQuadricClustering theoretically producing better results. In practice
 * however, vtkBinnedDecimation produces results that are visually close to
 * vtkQuadricClustering at speeds approaching 10-100x faster (depending on
 * the bin divisions, and how the output points are generated), and the
 * algorithm requires much less memory. Note that the API of this filter is a
 * subset of vtkQuadricClustering and can often be used interchangeably with
 * vtkQuadricClustering.
 *
 * @warning
 * Algorithm 4) BIN_CENTERS uses a very different implementation strategy
 * requiring a sort of all points. It scales better as the number of bins
 * increases.
 *
 * @warning
 * For certain types of geometry (e.g., a mostly 2D plane with jitter in the
 * normal direction), this decimator can perform badly. In this situation,
 * set the number of bins in the normal direction to one.
 *
 * @warning
 * This class has been threaded with vtkSMPTools. Using TBB or other
 * non-sequential execution type (set in the CMake variable
 * VTK_SMP_IMPLEMENTATION_TYPE) may improve performance significantly.
