/**
 * @class vtkSelectionNode
 * @brief a node in a vtkSelection the defines the selection criteria.
 *
 * vtkSelectionNode helps define the selection criteria in a vtkSelection.
 * vtkSelection can comprise of multiple such vtkSelectionNode instances that
 * help define the selection.
 *
 * vtkSelectionNode has two components: a list of properties (stored in a
 * vtkInformation) and a selection list (a vtkAbstractArray subclass). The
 * properties help indicate how to interpret the values specified in a
 * selection-list.
 *
 * The properties can be broadly classified into three categories: core,
 * qualifiers, and information. The core properties must be specified other wise the
 * vtkSelectionNode is not considered valid. These are `FIELD_TYPE` and
 * `CONTENT_TYPE`. `FIELD_TYPE` defines what kinds of entities are being selected.
 * Since selections are used select items in a data-object, these correspond to
 * things like cells, points, nodes, edges, rows, etc. Supported FIELD_TYPE
 * values are defined in `vtkSelectionNode::SelectionField`. `CONTENT_TYPE`
 * defines the how the selection is described. Supported values are
 * `vtkSelectionNode::SelectionContent`. For example, if CONTENT_TYPE is
 * `INDICES`, then selection is described as ids for entities being selected.
 * The ids themselves will be specified using the selection list. Thus, the
 * CONTENT_TYPE dictates what the selection list comprises.
 *
 * Qualifiers are used to further qualify the selection criteria. All qualifiers
 * are optional. When present they restrict the selection. For example, when
 * selecting elements from a composite-dataset, the `COMPOSITE_INDEX` qualifier
 * can be specified of limit the selection to a specific dataset (or subtree).
 *
 * Information properties are simply for informative purposes and generally used
 * to provide information about the selection when the selection is created. For
 * example, `PIXEL_COUNT` is used to indicate how many screen pixels resulted in
 * creation of this selection node.
 *
 * @section SelectionTypes Selection Types
 *
 * `CONTENT_TYPE` property is one of the required properties that helps
 * describe how the selection is defined. To set the content type, one can
 * access the properties store using `vtkSelectionNode::GetProperties()` and
 * then set the `CONTENT_TYPE` using the `vtkSelectionNode::CONTENT_TYPE()` key
 * or simply use `vtkSelectionNode::SetContentType`.
 *
 * * `vtkSelectionNode::GLOBALIDS`: indicates that the selection is defined
 *   using global ids. In VTK data-object, global ids are specified an `vtkIdTypeArray`
 *   added to a appropriate `vtkDataSetAttributes` and marked as global-ids
 *   using vtkDataSetAttributes API. Since global ids are expected to be unique
 *   for that element type over the entire dataset, it's a convenient way of
 *   defining selections. For this content-type, the selection list must be
 *   to a single-component, `vtkIdTypeArray` that lists all the globals ids for
 *   the selected elements.
 *
 * * `vtkSelectionNode::PEDIGREEIDS`: similar to `GLOBALIDS` except uses
 *   pedigree ids instead of global ids.
 *
 * * `vtkSelectionNode::VALUES`: this type is used to define a selection based
 *   on array values. The selection list specifies the values to be selected.
 *   All elements with array values in the selection list are treated as
 *   selected. The qualifier COMPONENT_NUMBER is used to indicate which
 *   component to use for the checks. Use `-1` for magnitude. Current
 *   implementation does not support checking multiple-components or non-exact
 *   matches although support for both is conceivable in future.
 *   The selection list array name is used to specify the name of the array from
 *   the dataset to use for the checks. Thus, for defining a selection for a
 *   dataset where all `TEMP` values match those specified in the selection
 *   list, ensure that the selection list array's name is set to `TEMP` as well.
 *
 * * `vtkSelectionNode::INDICES`: this is similar to global ids except in this
 *   case the selection list is simply the VTK element id which is 0-based
 *   index of that element in the particular dataset. Often with this type of
 *   selection, additional qualifiers such as `COMPOSITE_INDEX`,
 *   `BLOCK_SELECTORS`, `PROCESS_ID` etc. are needed to correctly identify the
 *   chosen element(s) in case of composite or distributed datasets.
 *
 * * `vtkSelectionNode::FRUSTUM: this type is used to define a frustum in world
 *   coordinates that identifies the selected elements. In this case, the
 *   selection list is a vtkDoubleArray with 32 values specifying the 8 frustum
 *   corners in homogeneous world coordinates.
 *
 * * `vtkSelectionNode::LOCATIONS`: this is used to select points (or cells)
 *   near (or containing) specified locations. The selection list is a
 *   3-compnent vtkDoubleArray with coordinates for locations of interest.
 *
 * * `vtkSelectionNode::THRESHOLDS`: this type is used to define a selection based
 *   on array value ranges. This is akin to thresholding. All elements with values in
 *   the specified ranges are to be treated as selected. For this content-type,
 *   the selection-list is a 2-component `vtkDataArray`-subclass that specifies
 *   where each tuple defines the min and max values for a range. The selection
 *   list can have multiple tuples to define multiple ranges. Elements with
 *   values in any of the specified ranges are treated as selected. The
 *   selection list array name is used to specify the name of the array from
 *   the dataset to use for the checks. Thus, for defining a selection for a
 *   dataset where all `TEMP` values are within a range, ensure that the
 *   selection list array's name is set to `TEMP` as well.
 *
 * * `vtkSelectionNode::BLOCKS`: this type is used to select blocks in a
 *   composite dataset. The term blocks is used loosely here and can correspond
 *   to a block in a multiblock dataset or a partition in a partitioned-dataset.
 *   The selection list is an integral type vtkDataArray subclass that can be 1-
 *   or 2- component. If 1-component, it's interpreted as the composite-index
 *   (also called flat index) and can be applied to any composite-dataset to
 *   choose specific datasets. If 2-component, it's typically associated with
 *   vtkUniformGridAMR or vtkPartitionedDataSetCollection which support 2-tuple
 *   indexing to locate a dataset.
 *
 * * `vtkSelectionNode::BLOCK_SELECTORS`: this is similar to BLOCKS, however
 *   instead of using indices to select datasets, here, the selection list is a
 *   vtkStringArray which lists selector expressions to select blocks in the
 *   composite dataset. By default, the selector expressions are applied to a
 *   vtkDataAssembly generated from the composite dataset that represents its
 *   hierarchy (see `vtkDataAssembly::GenerateHierarchy`). However, in case of
 *   vtkPartitionedDataSetCollection, one can select any other data assembly
 *   associated with the vtkPartitionedDataSetCollection by naming the array
 *   with the name of the assembly.
 *
 *   @note, currently vtkPartitionedDataSetCollection only supports a single
 *   vtkDataAssembly but this may change in the future.
 *
 * * `vtkSelectionNode::QUERY`: this type is primarily added for ParaView where
 *   selection expression is specified as a query string. This is likely to
 *   change in the future and hence applications are discouraged from using this
 *   type.
 *
 * @section Properties Properties
 *
 * Following a properties that can be used to qualify the selection.
 *
 * * `vtkSelectionNode::EPSILON()`: this is a qualifier that can be used to
 *   indicate a fuzz-factor when comparing values for equality. Currently, this
 *   is only used with content-type LOCATIONS, however, it can be expanded to
 *   other selection types in the future.
 *
 * * `vtkSelectionNode::CONTAINING_CELLS()`: this qualifier is intended to be
 *   used with field-type `POINT`. When present, it indicates that while the
 *   selection criteria selects a collection of points the selection should be
 *   formed using cell containing the chosen points.
 *
 * * `vtkSelectionNode::CONNECTED_LAYERS()`: a qualifier used to expand the
 *   definition of selected elements to connected elements for the specified
 *   number of layers. Layers can be positive or negative to grow or shrink the
 *   selection respectively.
 *
 * * `vtkSelectionNode::INVERSE()`: a qualifier that causes the selection to be
 *   inverted i.e. all elements not chosen by the criteria are to be treated
 *   as selected.
 *
 * * `vtkSelectionNode::COMPONENT_NUMBER()`: for VALUES and THRESHOLDS selection
 *   types, this qualifier identifies the array component of interest. -1
 *   indicates magnitude.
 *
 * * `vtkSelectionNode::PROCESS_ID()`: limits the selection to a particular
 *   rank in a distributed environment.
 *
 * * `vtkSelectionNode::COMPOSITE_INDEX()`: a qualifier used to limit the
 *   selection to a specific composite index for a composite-dataset.
 *
 * * `vtkSelectionNode::ASSEMBLY_NAME()`, `vtkSelectionNode::SELECTORS()`:
 *   similar to composite index, except uses data-assembly and selectors to
 *   limit the selection to a subset of nodes in a composite-dataset.
 *
 * * `vtkSelectionNode::HIERARCHICAL_LEVEL()`,
 *   `vtkSelectionNode::HIERARCHICAL_INDEX()`: similar to composite index, except
 *   uses level and index for an AMR dataset so limit the selection to a
 *   specific AMR level or dataset.
 *
 * Following for properties that are primarily intended to provide additional
 * information when the selection is created.
 *
 * * `vtkSelectionNode::ZBUFFER_VALUE()`: an information qualifier representing
 *   the z-depth for a particular selection when it was created.
 *
 * * `vtkSelectionNode::PIXEL_COUNT()`: a qualifier used to provide a count for
 *   the number of pixels that resulted in this selection.
 *
 * * `vtkSelectionNode::SOURCE()`, `vtkSelectionNode::SOURCE_ID()`: provides
 *   information about data producer or selection originator. The interpretation
 *   is very specific to the creator creating the selection and varies greatly
 *   with VTK.
 *
 * * `vtkSelectionNode::PROP(), `vtkSelectionNode::PROP_ID()`: similar to
 *   SOURCE/SOURCE_ID except is used to represent a rendering prop from which
 *   the selection was created.
 *
 * @warning
 * No SelectionList is created by default. It should be assigned.
 *
 * @section SelectionFieldMismatch vtkSelectionNode::SelectionField and
 * vtkDataSetAttribute::AttributeTypes
 *
 * Strictly speaking, vtkSelectionNode::SelectionField maps directly to
 * vtkDataSetAttribute::AttributeTypes. However, the two enum values are not
 * identical for historical reasons. Use
 * `vtkSelectionNode::ConvertSelectionFieldToAttributeType` and
 * `vtkSelectionNode::ConvertAttributeTypeToSelectionField` to convert between
 * the two.
