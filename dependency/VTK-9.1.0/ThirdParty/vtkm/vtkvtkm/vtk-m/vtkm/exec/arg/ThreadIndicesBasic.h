/// \brief Basic container for thread indices in a worklet invocation
///
/// During the execution of a worklet function in an execution environment
/// thread, VTK-m has to manage several indices. To simplify this management
/// and to provide a single place to store them (so that they do not have to be
/// recomputed), \c WorkletInvokeFunctor creates a \c ThreadIndices object.
/// This object gets passed to \c Fetch operations to help them load data.
///
/// All \c ThreadIndices classes should implement the functions provided in
/// the \c ThreadIndicesBasic class. (It is in fact a good idea to subclass
/// it.) Other \c ThreadIndices classes may provide additional indices if
/// appropriate for the scheduling.
