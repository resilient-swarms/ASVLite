/// \brief Class for loading and storing values in thread instance.
///
/// The \c Fetch class is used within a thread in the execution environment
/// to load a value from an execution object specific for the given thread
/// instance and to store a resulting value back in the object. (Either load
/// or store can be a no-op.)
///
/// \c Fetch is a templated class with four arguments. The first argument is a
/// tag declaring the type of fetch, which is usually tied to a particular type
/// of execution object. The second argument is an aspect tag that declares
/// what type of data to pull/push. Together, these two tags determine the
/// mechanism for the fetch. The third argument is the type of thread indices
/// used (one of the classes that starts with \c ThreadIndices in the
/// vtkm::exec::arg namespace), which defines the type of thread-local indices
/// available during the fetch. The fourth argument is the type of execution
/// object associated where the fetch (nominally) gets its data from. This
/// execution object is the data provided by the transport.
///
/// There is no generic implementation of \c Fetch. There are partial
/// specializations of \c Fetch for each mechanism (fetch-aspect tag
/// combination) supported. If you get a compiler error about an incomplete
/// type for \c Fetch, it means you used an invalid \c FetchTag - \c AspectTag
/// combination. Most likely this means that a parameter in an
/// ExecutionSignature with a particular aspect is pointing to the wrong
/// argument or an invalid argument in the ControlSignature.
