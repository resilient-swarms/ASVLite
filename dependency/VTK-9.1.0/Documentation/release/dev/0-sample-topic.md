## Short descriptive title

This is a sample release note for the change in a topic.
Developers should add similar notes for each topic branch
making a noteworthy change.  Each document should be named
and titled to match the topic name to avoid merge conflicts.

Tips for writing a good release note:

* Prefer active voice:

  ** Bad: A function to X was added to VTK.

  ** Good: VTK now provides function X.

* Write to the user, not about the user.

  ** Bad: Users can now do X with Y.

  ** Good: You can now do X with filter Y.

* Avoid referring to the current commit or merge request

* Add images to Documentation/release/dev
