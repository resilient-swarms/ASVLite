# ASVLite

## Introduction
ASVLite is a simulator that provides a computationally efficient model of ocean waves and dynamics of marine surface vehicles in waves. The simulator is ideal for applications requiring high run-time performance, such as simulation of a swarm of autonomous marine vehicles or developing optimal vehicle control strategies using reinforcement learning techniques. ASVLite also has a low computational overhead making it ideal for on-board simulation for applications such as online learning for adaptation to changes in the environment. When simulating a swarm of ASVs, ASVLite takes advantage of multiple CPU cores, when available, by multi-threading the computation for each ASV on parallel threads. ASVLite has been implemented with a clear and simple programming interface written in the C programming language, making it easy to integrate with any existing or future software. Refer to the section [Using ASVLite as a software library](#using-asvlite-as-a-software-library) for details of the programming interface.

## Build instruction
``` 
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/resilient-swarms/ASVLite.git
cd ASVLite
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make 
```

## Running the simulator

The simulator requires the following values as command-line arguments:
1. input file, 
2. output file,
3. significant wave height of the sea state to simulate, 
4. predominant wave direction of the wave,
5. random seed number.

Example for simulating vehicle dynamics in a sea with a significant wave height of 1.2 m, wave heading of 20<sup>o</sup>North and with a random number seed of 3:
```
ASVLite input_file out_file 1.2 20.0 3
```

The `input_file` uses `toml` syntax and should provide the inputs required for the simulation. Given below is an example of an input file.
