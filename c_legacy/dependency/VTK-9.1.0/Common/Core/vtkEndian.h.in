/* All compilers that support Mac OS X define either __BIG_ENDIAN__ or
   __LITTLE_ENDIAN__ to match the endianness of the architecture being
   compiled for. This is not necessarily the same as the architecture of the
   machine doing the building. In order to support Universal Binaries on
   Mac OS X, we prefer those defines to decide the endianness.
   On other platforms we use the result of the TRY_RUN. */
