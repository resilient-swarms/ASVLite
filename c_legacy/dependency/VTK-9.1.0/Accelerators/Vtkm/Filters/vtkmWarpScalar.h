/**
 * @class   vtkmWarpScalar
 * @brief   deform geometry with scalar data
 *
 * vtkmWarpScalar is a filter that modifies point coordinates by moving points
 * along point normals by the scalar amount times the scalar factor with vtkm
 * as its backend.
 * Useful for creating carpet or x-y-z plots.
 *
 * If normals are not present in data, the Normal instance variable will
 * be used as the direction along which to warp the geometry. If normals are
 * present but you would like to use the Normal instance variable, set the
 * UseNormal boolean to true.
 *
 * If XYPlane boolean is set true, then the z-value is considered to be
 * a scalar value (still scaled by scale factor), and the displacement is
 * along the z-axis. If scalars are also present, these are copied through
 * and can be used to color the surface.
 *
 * Note that the filter passes both its point data and cell data to
 * its output, except for normals, since these are distorted by the
 * warping.
