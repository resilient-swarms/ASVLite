/// \brief Construct the Contour Tree for a 2D or 3D regular mesh
///
/// This filter implements the parallel peak pruning algorithm. In contrast to
/// the ContourTreeUniform filter, this filter is optimized to allow for the
/// computation of the augmented contour tree, i.e., the contour tree including
/// all regular mesh vertices. Augmentation with regular vertices is used in
/// practice to compute statistics (e.g., volume), to segment the input mesh,
/// facilitate iso-value selection, enable localization of all verticies of a
/// mesh in the tree among others.
///
/// In addition to single-block computation, the filter also supports multi-block
/// regular grids. The blocks are processed in parallel using DIY and then the
/// tree are merged progressively using a binary-reduction scheme to compute the
/// final contour tree. I.e., in the multi-block context, the final tree is
/// constructed on rank 0.
