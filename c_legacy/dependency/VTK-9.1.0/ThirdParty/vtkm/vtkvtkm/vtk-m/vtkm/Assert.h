/// Asserts that \a condition resolves to true.  If \a condition is false,
/// then a diagnostic message is outputted and execution is terminated. The
/// behavior is essentially the same as the POSIX assert macro, but is
/// wrapped for added portability.
///
/// Like the POSIX assert macro, the check will be removed when compiling
/// in non-debug mode (specifically when NDEBUG is defined), so be prepared
/// for the possibility that the condition is never evaluated.
///
/// The VTKM_NO_ASSERT cmake and preprocessor option allows debugging builds
/// to remove assertions for performance reasons.
