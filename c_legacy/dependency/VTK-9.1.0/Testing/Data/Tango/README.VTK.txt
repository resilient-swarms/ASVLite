This directory contains an image of icons from the Tango Free Desktop Project and
it's subset Tango Icon Library version 0.8.1. The individual icons were montaged into
a single image to be used for testing of the vtkIconGlyphFilter class.

We would like to thank the Tango Free Desktop team for distributing these icons.
