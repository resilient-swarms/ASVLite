/**
 * @class   vtkTensorWidget
 * @brief   3D widget for manipulating a tensor glyph
 *
 * This 3D widget interacts with a vtkTensorRepresentation class (i.e., it
 * handles the events that drive its corresponding representation). The
 * widget is assumed to operate on a single 3x3 real, symmetric tensor
 * located at a specified position. The tensor implicitly defines three
 * orthogonal eigenvectors which indicate the orientation and relative
 * scaling of the widget's representation.
 *
 * The widget has the appearance of an oriented box with seven handles: one
 * at the center of the box, and six located at the center of each face. The
 * box can be translated by selecting its center handle; rotated by selecting
 * and rotating one of the box faces around the box center; and scaled (in a
 * particular direction) by selecting the face handles (located on each face)
 * and moving the faces in/out in the direction of the face normal. Uniform
 * scaling is also possible by (default) using the right mouse button (unless
 * the binding has been redefined).
 *
 * To use this widget, you generally pair it with a
 * vtkTensorRepresentation (or a subclass). Various options are
 * available in the representation for controlling the widgets' size and
 * position; how the widget appears; and how the widget functions.
 *
 * @par Event Bindings:
 * By default, the widget responds to the following VTK events (i.e., it
 * watches the vtkRenderWindowInteractor for these events):
 * <pre>
 * If one of the seven handles are selected:
 *   LeftButtonPressEvent - select the appropriate handle
 *   LeftButtonReleaseEvent - release the currently selected handle
 *   MouseMoveEvent - move the handle
 * If one of the faces is selected:
 *   LeftButtonPressEvent - select a box face
 *   LeftButtonReleaseEvent - release the box face
 *   MouseMoveEvent - rotate the box
 * In all the cases, independent of what is picked, the widget responds to the
 * following VTK events:
 *   MiddleButtonPressEvent - translate the widget
 *   MiddleButtonReleaseEvent - release the widget
 *   RightButtonPressEvent - scale the widget's representation
 *   RightButtonReleaseEvent - stop scaling the widget
 *   MouseMoveEvent - scale (if right button) or move (if middle button) the widget
 * </pre>
 *
 * @par Event Bindings:
 * Note that the event bindings described above can be changed using this
 * class's vtkWidgetEventTranslator. This class translates VTK events
 * into the vtkTensorWidget's widget events:
 * <pre>
 *   vtkWidgetEvent::Select -- some part of the widget has been selected
 *   vtkWidgetEvent::EndSelect -- the selection process has completed
 *   vtkWidgetEvent::Scale -- some part of the widget has been selected
 *   vtkWidgetEvent::EndScale -- the selection process has completed
 *   vtkWidgetEvent::Translate -- some part of the widget has been selected
 *   vtkWidgetEvent::EndTranslate -- the selection process has completed
 *   vtkWidgetEvent::Move -- a request for motion has been invoked
 * </pre>
 *
 * @par Event Bindings:
 * In turn, when these widget events are processed, the vtkTensorWidget
 * invokes the following VTK events on itself (which observers can listen for):
 * <pre>
 *   vtkCommand::StartInteractionEvent (on vtkWidgetEvent::Select)
 *   vtkCommand::EndInteractionEvent (on vtkWidgetEvent::EndSelect)
 *   vtkCommand::InteractionEvent (on vtkWidgetEvent::Move)
 * </pre>
 *
