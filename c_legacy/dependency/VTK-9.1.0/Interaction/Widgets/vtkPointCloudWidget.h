/**
 * @class   vtkPointCloudWidget
 * @brief   select and manipulate a point from a point cloud
 *
 * This 3D widget allows the user to query and select one point from a large
 * collection of points (i.e., a point cloud). It is typically paired with a
 * representation class such as vtkPointCloudRepresentation.
 *
 * The widget emits several events during usage. When a point is successfully
 * picked (via mousing over), it emits the vtkCommand::PickEvent. When a
 * selection occurs, the vtkCommand::WidgetActivateEvent is invoked.
 *
 * In usage this widget is typically paired with an additional widget to
 * provide local point editing (e.g., move a point, modify associated
 * attribute values); or uses callbacks (via the Observer mechanism) to
 * perform additional operations on the selected point.
 *
 * Typically the behavior of the widget is as follows. As the user mouses
 * over the point cloud, picking continuously occurs. If a point is 1) picked
 * (i.e., the cursor is within a tolerance) and 2) a different point is
 * picked, then a widget pick event is invoked. The user, by observing the
 * event, can display further information such as text strings
 * etc. Additionally, the user can select the point (typically a left mouse
 * button click) which invokes a widget select event.
