   * objects, will work on all systems, but is scalable to only a few tens of
   * thousands of points. (See vtkHardwareSelector and vtkPointPicker for
   * further information.) The choice of picker also has implications on the
   * type of tolerancing used (as described in the following documentation).
   * (Note also that the pickers may return slighty different results, this
   * is expected due to the different way tolerancing works.)
