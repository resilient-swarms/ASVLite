Provides an implementation for ASV controllers and extends ASVLite to simulate a tropical storm and wave glider dynamics in the storm.

## Dependency

Install dependency - [netCDF](https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c).

Although not a dependency for ASVLite, having the following tools will be useful to explore netCDF (.nc) files.
